Wow, just walked out of Heart Eyes and I'm not sure if I loved it or if it was just a strange fever dream. You know when you eat too much cheese and then you have those weird, vivid dreams? Kind of like that. The whole thing was like a roller coaster that decided halfway through to become a merry-go-round—tornado of emotions, then just spinning and spinning until you're not sure which way is up. 

I mean, the main character (let's just call him Mr. Emotional Whiplash) is something else. One minute he's all deep and philosophical, next he's throwing a tantrum like a toddler who just found out nap time is real. Reminds me of my cousin Tim who gets super existential after two beers, but then tries to argue that pickles are just lying cucumbers. But hey, it worked somehow, kept me glued to the screen in a what noise is he gonna make next kinda way.

> And the cinematography, don't even get me started. It was beautiful chaos, like the universe smashed a kaleidoscope into the camera lens and called it art. Colors everywhere! Like when your dog sneezes into a pile of Skittles and somehow ends up looking like a contemporary masterpiece. There were some seriously stunning shots though, like visual postcards from a place that doesn't exist—but also might? I dunno, it felt like a dream.

But ugh, that soundtrack. Are we still doing emo techno or did their music supervisor just time travel from 2007? I swear I heard the ghost of my awkward high school self singing along. Kinda loved it, but also kinda wanted to cringe into my hoodie.

void 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩Movie(int emotionalState) {
    if(emotionalState == CONFUSED) {
        // Process emotions
        feelAllTheFeels();
    }
}

Okay, okay, so I'm being overly dramatic. It's probably just post-  blues or whatever. There's something inexplicably addictive about it; I could see myself 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   just to catch all the little details I missed while my brain was playing pinball with my thoughts. Or maybe I'll just nag my friends to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   so we can debate over whether or not the main character is a secret genius or just needs a nap. Anyway, here's to  s that leave you dazzled, dazed, and a tad bit dizzy. Cheers.
